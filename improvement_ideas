Music puzzle
—————————
a smart phone app developed at [music hack day Sofia](http://music-hackathons.org/)

- add visual indicator  (e.g. with X and thick) for the the correct position of pieces When ‘play puzzle’ is pressed the indication appears below the piece. When any puzzle pieces are reordered, their indicator disappears.   
Remove popup!  (see design/)

- when the puzzle order is correct, the ‘proceed to next level’ message should appear in the bottom, not as pop up! 


- highlighting of piece being played

- add frame around puzzle area 

- make sure the correct order is not allowed as initial puzzle order

- when the user touches a piece, playback should stop (WORKING ON…)

- play original should play original (not correct order)


- There should be indication of beats: either vertical lines blinking or metronome-like sound
