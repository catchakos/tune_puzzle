- highlighting of piece being played

- indicate visually (e.g. with X and think, or thumb up and thumb down) the correct position of pieces when the button ‘play puzzle’ is pressed. This is especially important as a visual hint that the puzzle is scrambled in the beginning. Remove popup!  

- when the user touches a piece, playback should stop (WORKING ON…)


- play original should play original (not correct order)

- when the puzzle order is correct, the ‘proceed to next level’ message should appear in the bottom, not as pop up! 

- There should be indication of beats: either vertical lines blinking or metronome-like sound
